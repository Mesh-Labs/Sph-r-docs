# Benefits

The effectiveness of privacy is greatly increased by using complicated DeFi transactions. The variety of interactions in Sphär is increased by all lending, borrowing, trading, and interactions with dApps, and the likelihood that withdrawals may be traced back to deposits is reduced. In comparison to existing privacy systems, Sphär provides more reliable privacy with less liquidity and quicker speed to market. Users are encouraged to keep their assets in Sphär for longer periods of time since there are less reasons to shift money out of Sphär as a result of arbitrary dApp interactions within the privacy system of Sphär. If everything else is equal, Sphär will be objectively far less private than another privacy solution with the same level of liquidity.

Use cases Sphär aims to:

1. Secure data sharing
2. To avoid rug-pull on DeFi and auto revoke transaction on the protocol
3. Anonymous on-chain

For these reasons, Sphär is a game-changer and the most uncompromising and comprehensive privacy solution for DeFi. Private DeFi will open up new business opportunities for the bitcoin sector that would not be viable on public blockchains. All other privacy options come with certain drawbacks, such as having users to rely on custodial bridges or trade with fragmented/non-existent liquidity.
