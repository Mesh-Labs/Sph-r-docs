# What is Sphär?

Sphär is an on-chain privacy mechanism for Arbitrum, Optimism, Fantom and, soon, Zksync. To enable arbitrary smart contract calls in total privacy and without leaving the security of the user's preferred chain, it uses Zero-Knowledge (ZK) cryptography. Complete privacy is attained without the use of a custodial bridge or a separate Layer-2 validator set thanks to Sphär's on-chain architecture. This is superior at preventing information leakage or contamination and achieving airtight privacy. With Sphär, money are always protected since they never leave their host chain. Additionally, by enabling privacy directly on-chain, Sphär users may use all of the liquidity and ecosystems already present on the chain, resulting in a more natural DeFi experience that is similar to what users are accustomed to on public blockchains. This avoids a scenario where users of off-chain privacy solutions would need to wait until other DeFi users bridge across in order to have the best experience. With the addition of the private transaction option, the user interface is functionally identical to utilising a public wallet in terms of liquidity and DeFi support.
