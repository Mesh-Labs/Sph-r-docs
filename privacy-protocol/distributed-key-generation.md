# Distributed key generation

Distributed key generation (DKG) is a cryptographic method in which several parties contribute to the development of a shared public and private key set. Distributed key generation, unlike other public key encryption techniques, does not rely on Trusted Third Parties. Instead, the participation of a certain number of honest persons decides whether a key pair may be effectively computed. Distributed key generation prevents a single party from obtaining a private key. Because there are many parties involved, Distributed key generation is required to preserve confidentiality in the presence of malicious contributions to the key computation.

With DKG, Sph√§r is able to secure their key differently.
