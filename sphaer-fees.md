# Sph채r fees

In the Fantom or Ethereum ecosystem, gas is the fee required to execute transactions and smart contract operations on the blockchain. Gas is paid in the form of Ether (ETH) or FTM, which is the native cryptocurrency of the network.

When a user wants to interact with a smart contract, they must pay a gas fee in ETH to cover the cost of executing the transaction on the blockchain. This can be a barrier to entry for users who do not own any ETH, or for users who do not want to use their existing ETH to pay for gas.

## The Relayer&#x20;

Sph채r is a platform that aims to remove this barrier by offering a relayer service that can help users pay for gas fees without needing to own any ETH themselves. This is done by using a "gas token" that can be used to pay for gas fees in place of ETH. A relayer is an entity that acts as an intermediary between the user and the Ethereum network, by paying the gas fee on the user's behalf in exchange for the gas token.

The way it works:

1. A user will utilize the token they wish to transfer, which is fully backed by an equivalent amount of ETH.
2. The user can then use the gas token to pay for the gas fee required to execute a transaction or smart contract operation.
3. The relayer, in this case Sph채r, will then use their own ETH to pay the actual gas fee to the miner, and then collect the gas token from the user as payment for their service.

This allows users to interact with the blockchain without needing to own any native tokens themselves, by allowing them to pay for gas fees with a gas token instead.

For instance, when sending USDC on the Fantom network, traditionally you would need to have FTM, the native token of the network to pay for the gas fee. However, with the use of a relayer service, you can pay for the gas fee using USDC instead of FTM. This allows for a more convenient and user-friendly experience, as the user can transact using the currency they are already holding without needing to acquire the native token of the network.&#x20;

Sph채r will charge 0.15% on each transaction&#x20;
