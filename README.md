# Sph√§r

On-chain privacy protocols are a type of technology that enables the preservation of privacy in the process of executing transactions on a blockchain network. This is achieved through the use of advanced cryptographic techniques to conceal the identities of the parties involved in a transaction and to obscure the details of the transaction itself. This can provide significant benefits for users who value privacy and security and wish to keep their transactions private from third parties.
