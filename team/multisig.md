# Multisig

The Sph√§r team's multisig is made up of protocol contributors and our most trusted advisers. This multisig will no longer have influence over contracts once the emergency council is completely created.

The Team Multisig including:&#x20;

* Bryan
* Tom&#x20;

A signing weight of 3 is necessary to perform a transaction, albeit this amount is susceptible to fluctuate based on signer rotations and unforeseen situations. Any proxy access the multisig has will be blocked by a 12-hour timelock as an added layer of security.
