# Wallets and Keys

The Spending Key is an important tool for users of cryptocurrency. It allows them to prove ownership of their digital assets and initiate transactions. This key is similar to a private key in a regular cryptocurrency wallet, but it is used specifically with a private zero-knowledge address.

On the other hand, the Viewing Key is a tool that allows users to view all the transactions associated with a particular address, including private ones. This can be useful for audit purposes, as users can set a specific time frame for which the Viewing Key can observe transactions by defining the beginning and ending block numbers. For example, a user might want to use their Viewing Key to see all the transactions they made during a specific time.
